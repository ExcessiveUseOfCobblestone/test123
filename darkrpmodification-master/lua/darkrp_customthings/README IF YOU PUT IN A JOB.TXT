If you want to place a new job here is what you need to check for.

-- They are in jobs.lua [ok obvious]
-- If they are a Police-type, make sure to add them to the bottom of jobs.lua so they can want/warrant else they're running around with a useless battering ram.
-- If in a Faction/Team/whatever you want to call them, they have the following:
Agenda
Groupchat
Doorgroup
Demotegroup [Optional]
-- If they are a dealer group, they need to have Weapons AND Shipments [if it's a popular gunpack you can probably copy-paste online]
